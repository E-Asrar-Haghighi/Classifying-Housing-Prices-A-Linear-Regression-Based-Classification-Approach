# Classifying-Housing-Prices-A-Linear-Regression-Based-Classification-Approach
# *Problem Statement* #
In this project, we aim to explore the feasibility of using linear regression, a regression-focused algorithm, for solving a classification problem. The dataset chosen for this study is the Ames Housing dataset, which contains detailed information about residential properties. Specifically, the target variable is SalePrice, a continuous feature that will be transformed into discrete categories representing different price ranges (e.g., Low, Medium, High).

The challenge lies in adapting a regression algorithm to a classification task while addressing the practicalities and limitations of this unconventional approach. Through this project, we seek to gain insights into how linear regression performs as a classifier, the impact of one-hot encoding on categorical variables, and how the results compare to those from traditional classifiers, such as logistic regression.

Ultimately, this study not only tests the adaptability of regression methods but also provides a deeper understanding of their potential applications and limitations in classification scenarios.
